# Smartphone Data Analysis Project

## Overview

This project involves data analysis of smartphones using a dataset scraped from the Smartprix website. The objective is to gather insights into smartphone specifications, prices, and features through data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA).

## Data Sources

Data was collected from the  [Smartprix website](https://www.smartprix.com/mobiles)

## About Dataset

This dataset contains detailed information about various smartphones scraped from the Smartprix website. It includes key attributes such as model name, price, processor type, RAM capacity, storage options, camera specifications, battery life, and additional features. This dataset is ideal for predicting the price of smartphones based on various Features.
